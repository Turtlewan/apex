## In-Flight
| What | State | File | Next |
|------|-------|------|------|
(In-Flight EMPTY — orchestrator-activation COMPLETE 2026-08-02: all 8 tasks incl. owner-confirmed T2/T7, smoke passed, gate 9/9 exit 0, archived. ~/.claude commit `7cbd7ff` tracks all machinery blob-pinned. Adopt field-bug found+fixed+shipped same evening via the wrapper's own new event emission. All ledger orphans resolved; worktrees+branches torn down.)

## Open Questions

- **Wrapper-hygiene build SHIPPED 2026-08-01** (commits `d5d872f` ~/.claude · `ecd4a25` apex; handoff
  `docs/handoff/2026-08-01.md`). **Owner queue — 4 adjudication items** (details handoff § Owner
  adjudication; recommended: fold all into one small wave-3 "wrapper-hygiene follow-ups" spec):
  (1) -AllowSharedWorktree/exit-80 spec amendment (narrow live-sibling exclusion to running/stalled)
  (2) spec's `branch -[dD]` acceptance-grep narrowing, then remove the ([char]45) evasion
  ALL SIX OWNER ITEMS CLOSED by wrapper-follow-ups (shipped 2026-08-02). OWED TO OWNER at next
  attended moment: (a) one-line AGENTS.md ~/.claude verify-fence addition (events suite — parked
  host-state) (b) ~/.claude commit: 7 integrated wrapper files + 2 orchestrator artifacts +
  registry (git add -f by name; check concurrent-session dirt first) (c) adopt-sweep the 7
  dispatcher-test orphans — NOW RECOVERABLE via the shipped -Adopt -RunId any-phase fix.
- **Wave-3 queue** (unblocked now the wrapper build closed): preflight baseline digest→green cache
  + cheap-gates-first ordering (`docs/research/preflight-baseline-cache-plan-2026-07-31.md`) ·
  sandbox-TEMP fix (`docs/research/sandbox-temp-research-2026-07-30.md`) · P2(b/c) AGENTS.md verify
  contracts + per-worktree venv · family-gate integrated-tree digest binding · apex-plan:156
  residual (owned by orchestrator spec) · orchestrator spec re-alignment (row above; was "one-line
  fix" — invalidated by Sol r5).
- Queued analyses: `attended` telemetry definition (shipped in wrapper spec — verify in practice) ·
  effort-policy bakeoff evidence (P7 a3) · post-ship scope-check re-census (~10 build days after wave 2).
- **Harness kill anomaly (2026-07-31/08-01):** background dispatches externally killed 4/9 (whole
  tree; owner says not them; cause unknown); foreground 10-min timeout also kills the tree;
  schtasks/Start-Process detachment classifier-blocked. Mitigations in memory + handoff. Watch.
- Remaining catalogued debt: scopelock's 2 pre-existing failures · `tasks/` runtime-exclusion
  (P5(d) shipped — verify). Cleanup DONE 2026-08-01: all 5 apex-wt-* worktrees removed (adr032's
  transplanted ADR edits stashed on `codex/adr032`), 368 Sol plan-check temp files deleted;
  c45/artemis worktrees were already gone. 2026-08-01 late: both apex-worktree orphans
  (audit-step2-m2b-m3 task10 ×2) resolved via -Adopt → adopted-blocked (abandon refuses exit-82 on
  the dirty tree; adopt is the working recovery for dead orphans). STILL OWED: ~24 orphans on
  OTHER worktrees — ~9 hold ~/.claude and will exit-80-wedge any dispatch there under the new
  strict wrapper (adopt-sweep at a clean moment) · ledger orphan `3b651688` abandon (exit-82,
  dirty ~/.claude) · owner branch deletions (D8): `codex/retro-wrapper-hygiene`, `codex/adr032`,
  `codex/retro-planning-gates`, `codex/retro-scope-check`, `codex/retro-valver`, `wave-c45`.
- A concurrent session is active in this repo and ~/.claude (its `docs/drafts/gpt-5.6-family-adoption.md`
  edit and `hooks/apex-ledger-append.ps1` are theirs — do not touch, do not commit).
